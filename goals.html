              As a member of Georgia Tech Solar Racing, I'm gaining hands-on EE experience beyond the classroom. 
              I work on power optimization, distribution, embedded systems, and circuit design, while learning practical team skills like scheduling, meeting deadlines, and managing projects. 
              I also aim to take on a leadership role in the future.

              I plan to spend two months of intensive German courses over the summer. 
              This takes place in both Vienna and Berlin and will allow for me to complete my German minor.
              The program also focuses on German business language which will be crucial for my pursuit of a job 
              overseas.
